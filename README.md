# Put a ring on it

In this game, jump from asteroid to asteroid to draw the planet's ring the best you can without falling ! The atmosphere of the game was carefully designed with textures and post-processing layers, for the halo and depth of field effects. The spaceman was designed and animated in Blender.
Built in Three.js and Blender
